## About

A simple game in which you try to guess as many words as you can in a row based on a crossword-style clue, and word length.

Guess as many words as you can! But be careful, if you get one wrong you lose 1 heart. When you run out of hearts, the game is over!

## Usage

## Build

If you want to run and test on a local machine:

- Run `yarn install` or `yarn add parcel --dev`
- To test on localhost run `yarn start` and navigate to `localhost:1234` in your web browser
- To build run `yarn build`

Alternatively, if you're using Nova, use the Parcel task. The `build` and `run` functions are already scripted. ðŸ™‚
