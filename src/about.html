			<h1>Thoughts on Building a Word Game</h1>
			<p>
				Over this past weekend (February 11 - 15, 2022), I built what I consider
				to be a minimum viable product, or MVP, for a simple word game.
			</p>
			<p>
				This game, simply called Word Game, was inspired by
				<a href="https://syntax.fm/show/430/creator-of-wordle-josh-wardle"
					>an interview I heard with the creator of Wordle</a
				>, and my love of crossword puzzles. Armed with an online crossword
				dictionary, Nova (my code editor of choice), and copious amounts of
				decaf coffee, I built something I think is pretty cool.
			</p>

			<p>My goals for the project were simple:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Make something fun and catchy.</li>
				<li>Don’t use any JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, etc).</li>
				<li>Keep the project as simple as possible.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>So, how do I think I did? Let’s find out…</p>
			<h3 id="tech-stack">Tech Stack</h3>
			<p>
				In terms of the tech stack, I think I achieved what I set out to do. The
				game is written with pure vanilla JavaScript, and it all runs client
				side. There’s nothing running server-side.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <code>script.js</code> file, which contains all the game logic and
				modifies the DOM, is just under 4kb as of this writing. While I enjoy
				working in frameworks like React, something about knowing and
				understanding every line of code that powers what I built is extremely
				empowering, and something I&#39;ve missed the last several months since
				graduating boot camp.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the CSS is another story. I wanted to focus more on building
				the game itself, and less on the “front end”, so I used
				<a href="https://picocss.com">Pico.css</a>, an extremely minimal CSS
				library. The upside, I have to write very little CSS myself, and it’s a
				lot more lightweight than something like Bootstrap or Tailwind. But the
				downside, Pico.css may be too limited for the scope of this project, and
				I may transition to another library as I develop the project further.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, I avoided building a database, perhaps my least favorite thing
				to do, first by storing the game data (specifically the word clues and
				answers) in a
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13">ROT13-encypted</a> JSON
				file, and second by using local browser storage to save user data.
			</p>
			<h3 id="game-design">Game Design</h3>
			<p>
				In terms of the design of the game itself, I set out not just to make
				something that’s fun, but something that would get somebody competing
				with themselves to get a better score, and eventually competing with
				friends.
			</p>
			<p>
				My previous experience building a game was when I helped build a trivia
				game as part of a group project when attending boot camp. I looked at
				what worked, and what didn’t, and applied those ideas to this game.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the trivia game, the player had to answer as many trivia questions as
				they could within a given time period. The game would then save the
				players high score to a scoreboard. While I followed a similar model
				with Word Game, I made a few adjustments to the formula:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Removed the timer; I wanted to make a fun, relaxing game akin to a
					crossword puzzle. A timer would add unnecessary stress. Instead, I
					implemented a “lives” system that allows 3 incorrect guesses across a
					game session.
				</li>
				<li>
					Removed score board in lieu of a single high score counter; Many of
					the devices we use are personal, and we’re the only ones that use
					them. As such, it was simpler for development to assume only one
					player per device.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
			<p>
				Like with any development project, issues are going to arise. Due to the
				simplicity of the project, I didn&#39;t run into a huge amount of
				technical issues, but I did run into a showstopper, swhich I was able to
				resolve by the end of the weekend.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Local storage didn&#39;t work!</strong></p>
			<p>
				When I sent the game to friends I was informed that their high scores
				weren&#39;t saving. I tested the code on my machine’s local server
				several times after getting that feedback, and it worked fine. Tried the
				deployed version, no dice.
			</p>
			<p>
				After totally rewriting how I handle starting a new game after hitting
				“game over”, I realized an if statement I had written ensured that the
				only way a new local storage entry would be created would be if that
				entry already existed. If that broke your brain when you read that,
				don’t worry it broke my brain when I wrote it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Essentially, the if statement was checking for a truthy value rather
				than a falsey, and as such would never actually create a local storage
				entry. Oops!
			</p>
			<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
			<p>
				As I mentioned in the last section, I got some feedback on this game.
				It’s easy for us to be caught up in our own work, and lose sight of
				objectivity, or maybe just get stuck on resolving a design issue and
				need an outside opinion.
			</p>
			<p>
				As such, I had a small pre-alpha testing group of 3. It was mostly
				positive, but one issue that came up was that the game is too
				frustrating.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ok well, the exact words were “a little frustrating”, but even a little
				frustrating is too frustrating for the type of game I’m trying to make.
				I want it to be fun, catchy, something people would want to come back to
				and play to beat their high score.
			</p>
			<p>
				Any frustration is going to cause friction in that experience, and as a
				result I failed goal number 1; Make something fun and catchy.
			</p>
			<h3 id="lessons-future-developments">
				Lessons &amp; Future Developments
			</h3>
			<p>
				I think the biggest takeaway from this first weekend is that I need to
				take several aspects of the game back to the drawing board.
			</p>
			<p>
				I need to find a way to remove the friction, but at the same time not
				make it too easy. I played around with some ideas, like offering the
				player an extra hint in the form of giving away the letters but
				scrambled up, but I quickly found that the algorithm I used would
				sometimes just give the answer away. That’s no fun.
			</p>
			<p>
				I did add a counter that displays the number of letters in the answer,
				but during testing it didn’t seem to alleviate the frustration much.
			</p>
			<p>I’m left with 2 options:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Refine the current formula and try to reduce the friction.</li>
				<li>
					Throw away 90% of my code base and rethink the game structure
					entirely.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Not sure which way to go…</p>
